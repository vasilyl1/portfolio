An effective portfolio highlights strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Candidates who have portfolios with deployed web applications (live on the web applications) have an advantage in their career search. 

In many cases several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an invitation for the interview from the potential employer.

Skills used to create this project: flexbox, media queries, CSS variables to name a few.
